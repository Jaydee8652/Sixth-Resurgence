6bgrp_falcon_vi,SHIP,"Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector. 

The Admiralty of the Sixth Battlegroup found the armament of the traditional Falcon to be somewhat lacklustre, especially when sent to capture strategic points of interest with only a light escort. For this reason the majority of Falcons under the Sixth were heavily refitted with Domain Era techniques, installing a complicated Missile feed mechanism and Autoforge which are now impossible to fully replicate. While these systems require intensive maintenance protocols and are prone to failure during battle, they substantially increase the ships capability over standard hulls. 

These modifications were deemed significant enough to change the ship designation to Missile Cruiser, a relatively unique identifier which fit closer with the Sixth Battlegroup's reliance on Missile weaponry. 

It has been noted by Domain Archaeologists that the modifications done to the Falcon by pirates are shockingly similar to those performed on the Falcon (VI), albeit to a much lower quality. This suggests that in the time between the Sixth rotating out of the Persean Sector and the end of the Cold Passage enterprising pirates found and reverse engineered a Falcon (VI) left behind for the Fourteenth Battlegroup. ",,,,
6bgrp_heron_vi,SHIP,"The Heron provides the strategic and tactical mobility of a cruiser with potential firepower limited only by available strike-craft. It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleet of an admiral who knows when to take the initiative, hit quickly, and withdraw while enemy forces are still responding to the threat.

Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, the Sixth Battlegroup was one of the few core Domain Battlegroups to fully embrace the ""Cruiser School"" doctrine the Heron was designed to complement, making it a staple in their fleets. 

It is often said the Admiralty of the Sixth Battlegroup resented how quickly the leadership of the other core Domain Armada would “flip flop” between different doctrines. They claimed this was reducing the efficacy of the Domain Navy as a whole by splitting design resources between ships that were fundamentally incompatible with one another. Domain Historians note that the word “quickly” here is not particularly apt as these shifts often correlated with new generations of leadership. It is as obvious now as it was then that what they really resented was a lack of funding for their pet projects.",,,,
6bgrp_pegasus_vi,SHIP,"The Pegasus was an aspirational design initiative by Altair Exotech building off the immense profit and prestige generated by the ""Cruiser School"" turn of the Domain Armada procurement arm. The Pegasus anchored several of the newer battlegroups and found favor among a generation of young officers, especially those of the Sixth Battlegroup, who had long pushed for a Battleship that fit with their Missile focused doctrine.

All of the Pegasus-class under the Sixth were heavily refitted with Domain Era techniques, installing a complicated Missile feed mechanism and Autoforge which are now impossible to fully replicate. While these systems require intensive maintenance protocols and are prone to failure during battle, they substantially increase the ships capability over standard hulls.

These modifications were deemed significant enough to change the ship designation to Missile Battleship, a relatively unique identifier which fit closer with the Sixth Battlegroup's reliance on Missile weaponry.

The Admiralty of the Sixth Battlegroup had the asymmetric auxiliary bridge fitted with an advanced Holosuite and Military Encryption Centre. Fleet Command Staff stationed within could focus on and direct the entirety of the engagement, while the Command Staff of the primary bridge could direct the operations of the ship. This allows for finer control of operations, complimenting the manoeuvrability of a Sixth Battlegroup Fleet and makes the Pegasus (VI) well suited to be a flagship.",,,,
6bgrp_monitor_vi,SHIP,"The Monitor since its first deployment was always favoured by the Sixth Battlegroup who in accordance with the “Cruiser School” doctrine rarely fielded venerable fleet anchors such as the Legion or Onslaught. While not a substitute for either, the Monitor can take an impressive amount of punishment from a superior force while still being incredibly manoeuvrable, which fits more closely with the tactics employed by the Sixth Battlegroup.

The Admiralty of the Sixth Battlegroup had become increasingly frustrated by the Officers in command of Monitors who, in a vein attempt at seeking glory, often dropped the ships Fortress Shield to fire the stock Monitors negligible armament, resulting in the ships destruction. It is for this reason that the Monitor (VI) had all of its weapons stripped out and replaced with a small flight deck, removing such temptations. While even more serious solutions were considered, such as removing the ability for the ship to lower its shields at all, this solution was effective and increased the ships survivability long enough for Officers to gain some common sense.",,,,
6bgrp_mastery,SHIP,"The Mastery-class battlecruiser is the embodiment of concentrated firepower, even more so than its predecessor the Conquest. Developed at the direct request of the Admiralty of the Sixth Battlegroup, who pulled in several favours with the designers of the Pegasus, Altair Exotech. 

The Mastery was somewhat paradoxically designed as a fleet anchor for the “Cruiser School” doctrine, where it would be a wall from which Herons could strike behind. If the Pegasus was seen as an imposition on the territory of Orion Shipyards, the Mastery was effectively a saturation bombardment. It was a faux pas among core Domain Admiralty to even consider deploying the Mastery over an Onslaught. As they fill mostly the same role in a fleet operating under “Decisive Battle” doctrine, this was not an issue for established fleets. It is for this reason the ship is a rare sight anywhere, let alone in the Persean Sector. 

Critics of the ship often point out the ships vulnerability to flanking, even more so than most Battleships because of its unorthodox shape. Counter-critics insist that the support of more manoeuvrable ships or fighters offsets this issue, and the withering fire the front of a Mastery can bring to bear is unmatched, especially for a ship with such good handling thanks to the thrusters on both hammerhead arms.",,,,

As the ship was requested by and effectively designed for the Sixth Battlegroup, they are incredibly proud of the ship and have many stratagems designed specifically around its strengths and weaknesses. Almost the entire production run of the Mastery was retrofitted by the Sixth Battlegroup, who improved its Targeting Core. Although Tri-Tachyon deny any and all rumours of needing to reverse engineer anything as their image depends on being the forefront of innovation, suspiciously similar Targeting Cores are often found on Paragon Class Battleships.",,,,
6bgrp_shoebill,SHIP,"An interesting effect of the later era of Domain Expansion was the ever increasing amount of inhabited Frontier Space. As the Domain Sphere of influence spread, more and more fleets, especially those utilizing the “Cruiser School” doctrine who specialised in rapid responses were expected to operate mostly independently. Without the logistical and combat advantages provided by a station, these fleets were especially vulnerable to harrying and attrition. 

It is for this reason that the Shoebill was developed. While not anywhere near as durable as a Battlestation, or as well armed, it provides an important anchor for fleets. With a large hanger bay and multiple maintenance arms for repairing ships, it is equipped to perform repairs and ship recoveries while on the move. A large navigation computer also provides a boon primarily to the ships compliment of Fighters, but also the rest of the fleet.

The Shoebill is uniquely capable in being the first ever commissioned Minelayer type vessel, with a large dorsal bay housing a unique and complicated Mine Autoforge, classically only found on the largest of stations. While not especially deadly on their own, these mines apply a constant pressure to enemy fleets, making them more vulnerable to the Missile and Fighter heavy loadouts of most “Cruiser School” fleets.",,,,

The Sixth Battlegroup, deployed to the backwater Persean Sector were especially fond of the Shoebill, while they maintained many in their fleets, they often only deployed them one at a time due to the diminishing returns provided by minefields. ",,,,
6bgrp_hammerhead_vi,SHIP,"A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities.

The Admiralty of the Sixth Battlegroup found the stock Hammerhead, while not a poor design, both vulnerable to fighters and lacking in its contribution to the soft factors of an engagement. It is for this reason, inspired by the recent development of the Omen that they retrofitted many Hammerheads with an Advanced EMP Emitter, developed and tuned specifically for the ship. A dedicated ECM Suite and navigation computer were also implemented to help support the fleet the ship was attached to.

These changes were deemed significant enough to change the ships designation to ECM Destroyer, an uncommon designation as most ECM Support vessels are classically either Frigates or Cruisers.",,,,

6bgrp_advanced_emp,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates an advanced EMP generator. Nearby missiles, fighters, weapon emplacements and engines of enemy ships are all targeted and can be disabled in short order.

Unfortunately, on-board weapon systems must be shut down to provide power for this device. The EMP pulses are also not very effective against enemy shields.",Special,"Generates lightning arcs that quickly knock out enemy missiles, weapons, and engines within range. Mostly negated by shields. Devised by the Sixth Battlegroup for use on their ships.",,
