Small mod for Starsector [0.97a-RC11]. Adds variants of ships built for the Sixth Battlegroup, who were rotated out of the Persean Sector just before the Collapse. This is the "lore friendly" version, if you're playing with VRI please install Seventh Resurgence instead to avoid oddiites and conflicitng lore.
