Sixth Battlegroup,Sixth,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.Sixth,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup which was rotated out of the Persean Sector before the Collapse. Ships damaged in small skirmishes just before the changover were reluctantly left behind, with the intent for the disgraced 14th Battlegroup to restore them and bolster their own numbers. Unfortunately very few remained where they had been stored after the Cold Passage, having been pushed into service by however found them in the interim. It is a prime specimen of the 6th Battlegroup's unorthadox full acceptance of the ""Cruiser School"" doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of armour cutbacks and drive tunings (performed with pre-Collapse industrial methods) which, while reducing armor plate density by %s, allow for a %s increase in speed, handling and maneuverability. Exceptionally well-tuned energy systems increase flux throughput and capacity by %s over standard examples of this hull.",,,graphics/hullmods/6bgrp_sixth.png
